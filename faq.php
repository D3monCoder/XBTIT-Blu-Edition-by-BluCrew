<a href='#'>How do I change the look of the site/theme?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>
<br>
The easiest way is to go to the \"Home\" page and on the left hand side of the page under your name and information, you will see the word, \"Style\". Underneath that is a pulldown menu that shows the current theme that you are using for the site. At the time this is written, there are four themes to choose from; Modern, Tron, Light, and Blu. Feel free to choose the one that you like best. Although, it should be known that any upgrades to the site graphic-wise normally are done on the Modern theme.</p>

</ul>

<li>
<a href='#'>Am I able to park my account?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>

<br>
Yes. If you click on \"USER CP\" at the top of the site and then \"Change Profile\" listed on the menu at the right hand side, you will be able to modify your profile. Midway down the page is an option to check a box next to \"Park Account\". Be sure to scroll
to the bottom of the page and hit the \"Confirm\" button and you should be good.</p>

<li>
<a href='#'> What are the seeding/ratio rules here?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>For every torrent that you download, you MUST seed that torrent for a length of 7 days. Of course seeding for more then that is always encouraged and welcomed.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>
<a href='#'>If I downloaded a Freeleech torrent, do I still have to follow the seeding/ratio rules?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>Yes. A Freeleech torrent that you download must be seeded for a length of 7 days.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>
<a href='#'>What does H&amp;R mean?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>H&R stands for \"Hit and Run\". That basically means that someone has downloaded a torrent, and once it's done, they do not seed it for the required length of 7 days</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a href='#'>I downloaded a torrent but it was dead. Will I get an H&amp;R Warning?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>No. You will not get an H&amp;R if you stop and delete a torrent that you haven't fully downloaded, whether it was dead or some other reason. The H&amp;R rules kick into effect once you download 1024MB of the file. Once you have downloaded 1024MB of the file then you are considered a seeder and the rules go into effect.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a href='#'>The power went out/My internet got cut off/My computer was turned off...Will I get an H&amp;R?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>You have up to 3 days at a time to disconnect from seeding without getting an H&amp;R. If you are disconnected from the tracker (aka not seeding) for over 3 days, then the system will issue you an H&amp;R warning. </p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a href='#'> I got an H&amp;R Warning. What happens now?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>H&R Warnings last for 14 days. (per warning) . If you don't want the warning to last 14 days you can reseed the torrent you got the warning on for 7days. Once met the warning will be removed. Otherwise it will last 14 days. If you get 3 active H&R warnings, you will be banned for 30 days. While seeding a torrent to meet the 7 days, you have a max of three days to not seed it. If you go over 3 days and  7 days is not met you will receive the warning in that specific torrent. </p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a href='#'>How do I know how long I have been seeding for?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>Each torrent that you have downloaded and are seeding is shown to you at the bottom of your profile page, along with the length of time you have been seeding them. Just click on your user name at the top of any page on the site to go
to your profile page.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a href='#'>What does Freeleech mean?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>Freeleech means that what you download isn't applied towards your ratio. You do however have to seed a Freeleech torrent back the required length of 7 days.<br>
There are several types of Freeleech torrents here:<br>
-Global Freeleech: Every torrent on the site is 100% free. No download stats will be counted.<br>
-Gold Freeleech: That torrent is 100% free. Download stats for it will not be counted.<br>
-Silver Freeleech: That torrent is 50% free. Only half (50%) of the download stats for it will count.<br>
-Bronze Freeleech: That torrent is 25% free. Only 75% of the download stats for it will count.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a href='#'>How do I resume a broken download or reseed something?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>Open the .torrent file. When your client asks you for a location, choose the location of the existing file(s) and it will resume/reseed the torrent.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a href='#'>My download stopped at 99% and it's stuck. What do I do?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>the more pieces that you have, the harder it becomes to find peers who have the pieces that you are missing. That is why downloads sometimes slow down or even stall when there is just a little bit left to go. Just be patient and sooner or later you will get the rest of the file. The .torrent file might also be broken, so if everyone else only gets 99% and there is a seeder, then you should report the torrent to the Mods.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a href='#'>How do I know if a torrent is eligible for a reseed?</a>
<ul class='faq-content'>
<li>
<div>
<p>If a torrent meets the following conditions, a Reseed button will appear:<br>
minimum amount of seeds: 0<br>
minimum finished: 1<br>
mimimum leechers: 1<br>
minimum aga of torrent (days): 1<br>
minimum amount of days since the last reseed request: 5</p>

<p>Chat is a friendly place where we can talk to each other, but if the staff feel that you are being abusive towards others or not following the rules of the site, they will ban you from the chat. Usually this is only temporary, but more aggressive behaviors lead to more permanent solutions. Do not try to go against the staff, you will only make things worse. Treat them and others with respect, and you will receive the same.</p>
