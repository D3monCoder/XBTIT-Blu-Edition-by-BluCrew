	If an invite is pending, the invite token will be visible. Sometimes mail servers can block emails, take a long time to get the email or simply don't issue emails because of faulty settings. If such an error occurs you can give someone the invite token and that user can still become a member of the tracker even if the email has not been received. Also, if for some reason or another you want to delete the pending invite, you can do so here via the action column and the invite will return to your invite pool.<br /><br />
	If the invite is registered, the username registered with that invite will be viewable in the email tab and the delete action will be replaced with a view account action. Sometimes users invited by you will get pruned, deleted, banned, etc. If such a thing will happen the username will be replaced with <b>DELETED USER</b>, in such a case you should consider notifying the tracker owner or admins and maybe get the invite back.<br />
