<b>:DOCUMENTATION:</b><br>
<i>PHP TRACKER AND INTERNAL FORUM <br>
This is the easiest and fastest way to get your tracker up and running!</i>
<br>
- Place the xbtitFM Blu-Edition code in your webroot<br>
- Create your database (utf8_unicode_ci) and a database user using your application of choice like phpMyAdmin. Grant your database user usage privileges (data+structure, not grant/administration)<br>
- Use a web browser to open the site<br>
- Follow the instructions displayed by the installer<br>
- Once install is complete delete the install.php from your server<br>
- Log into your new site with the username and password you created during the install process<br>
- Enter the admin control panel and set your tracker's URL and announce URL's (delete the example announce with the :2710) and set your preferences and then save the settings.<br>
- Take some time to go through the admin panel and get used to everything from settings, hacks, modules and more.<br>
- Enjoy!<br>

<i>GENERAL NOTES:<br>
- Look to your Users Group Settings, do they match what you want?<br>
- You need to create the boards for your internal forum.<br>
- It is a lot of new stuff to take in, any bugs please open a issue on git.</i><br>

- This script takes the best of XBTIT, XBTITFM, XBTIT DT FM and XBTIT DT DC so credit to all the developers and participents in those named scripts. (That being said XBTIT Blu-Edition is still very much different but without XBTIT CORE this script would not be availble so giving credit where credit is due!)<br>
