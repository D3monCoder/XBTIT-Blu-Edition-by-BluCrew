XBTIT Blu Edition by BluCrew


ABOUT 

XBTIT Blu Edition is based off Xbtit, XbtitDTFM, XbtitDTDC and XbtitFM. Taking the best from all versions and combining it into one. So lets start off by giving credit to the dev teams of the projects mention above! While XBTIT Blu Edition maybe based off these the code is very different. Most of it has been fully rewritten and optimized for better navigation. NO MORE MESSY CODE! One major change is no more theming that looks very very outdated. XBTIT Blu Edition is fully rewritten in BOOTSTRAP {LESS} + FONT-AWESOME making the site look Modern and tasteful. One Style folder is all thats needed....want to change your style? Simply just write a new css file and change the look of your site via a selector that calls between custom bootstrap.css files. The also greatly increases the load time of your site since there is no more heavy images and crud built in like the old themes.

XBTIT Blu Edition will remain active and alive in OPEN SOURCE soon! This will not be a paid script! Although donations are open for receiving, we leave that completely up to you to decide weather you think its worth it or not. We also hope to see contributions added but we will be strict on what to add and what not to. We don't want to add hacks or modules that are sloppy coded. So we ask anyone that wants to contribute to please try to make the code neat and organized. We will review them and do further clean-up if needed.
